# UNFINISHED

It's an exciting time for all curious minds.

For the first time since our beginning in 2005 we are publishing in a transparent, auditable and collaborative way our vision and ambition for how our community may continue to grow over the coming years. The document [UNFINISHED DREAMS](https://github.com/UNFINISHEDDREAMS/UNFINISHED/blob/main/UNFINISHEDDREAMS.pdf) maps out the micro-universe we have been building, along with the values that drive it forward.

Gathering 71 countries currently, we are today as committed as ever to use culture to provide intellectual and physical space(s) for experimentation and build bridges wherever they're missing. All the projects outlined in this plan  – past, current or future – are part of our trajectory and long-standing commitment to create meaningful content, spaces and experiences for more conscious, productive and empathetic exchanges across the world. Using blockchain time-stamping, we're pleased to launch this masterplan in the decentralised spirit of the very forces that strengthen these UNFINISHED Dreams.

Driven by curiosity and UNFINISHED as we are, real ecosystems improve from difference and thrive from disturbance. So help us help ourselves, and get curious! Anyone, anything, anywhere  – everyone, everything, everywhere!  – is welcome and wanted for change and collaboration.
